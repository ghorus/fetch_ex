#Fetch Exercise

###Description
This application fetches data from an API: https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json

The application features not only the sorting of the extracted data by **"listId"** but also **"name"**. It has additional features such as:
- Font size change
- Dark/Light Mode
- Search

The challenges faced during production were: being new to Kotlin, Android Studio, and slow testing. Additional features that I hope to implement in the future are like such [Fetch Exercise Original Design](https://imgur.com/a/jkmbK7h)
